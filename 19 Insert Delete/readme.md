# 19 CRUD Operations - INSERT, DELETE
Now let's see now we can insert new records and delete unwanted records from our database. 

In this case, we will use Exec() to achieve this. 
Exec() will execute a query without returning any rows, it returns a Result type and an error.
Result Type has the following: 
1. LastInsertId() - returns (int64, error), the integer generated by the database in response to command
2. RowsAffected() - returns (int64, error), the number of rows affected by UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE

SQL Insert Query: 
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) 
VALUES (value1, value2, ...); 
```

SQL Delete Query: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE <conditions>; 
```
SQL Update Query: 
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE <conditions>; 
```
